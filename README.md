	C # Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework


Projects: 

- Car Insurance

- NFL Stats

Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. it takes user's input on policy information 
and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have
been issued.

NFL Stats

This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display football stats for the purposed of fantasy football.
it is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data access and a Code First workflow. it is still a work in progress.
